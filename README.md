# Crypto-Manager

The Crypto-Manager is supposed to be a easy and free way of tracking your crypto portfolio. I became interested in cryptocurrency a couple of years ago and during the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to learn to code. I am exspecially interested in the Data Analytics/ Science sphere. 
This project was a fun way for me to practice following essential skills:
  - Calling an api (https://developers.coinbase.com/)
  - Transforming the data 
  - OOP
  - Writing to a csv file

I thought a fun way of actually using the programm would be to hock it up to the computer management (Windows). It could run in the backround and call the coinbase api on a daily basis to keep track of rates, values and profits (hopefully).
